\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The maximum circular velocity and the radius where it is reached} are 
computed using

\begin{equation}
    v_{\rm{}max} = \sqrt{\frac{G M(\leq{}r)}{r}},
\end{equation}

where the cumulative mass $M(\leq{}r)$ includes all particles within the radius $r$, and includes the 
contribution of the particle(s) at $r=0$. The radius is computed relative to the centre of potential.
