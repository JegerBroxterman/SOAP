\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The satellite mass fraction} is obtained by summing the masses of all 
particles within the inclusive sphere that are bound to a halo that is not the central (sub-)halo, and 
dividing this by $M_{\rm{}SO}$. This uses the same membership information that is also used to decide what 
particles need to be included in the exclusive sphere and projected aperture properties.
